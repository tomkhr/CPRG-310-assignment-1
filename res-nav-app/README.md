Assignment: Creating a Responsive Navigation Menu
Tom Khrustalev (000962008)

===================== ReadMe =====================

1. Design Choices:

    My approach to the design of this navigation menu was to first design the UI and the layout of the page in Figma, to use that as a visual reference to try to build my code to appear as identical to it as possible. I decided to go for a clean and high-contrast look to allow for better readability. 

    To see a screenshot of the Figma design for the web and mobile UI, please refer to the "UI_Design.jpg" file that is located with the same folder as this ReadMe.

2. Implementation Approach:

    Having the Figma design allowed me to have a better understanding of how I need to structure my HTML and CSS in order to achieve the layout I was going for. It added more clarity to where do I need to nest some elements inside a div, what elements need to use flex-box, and some other clarifications provided by the visual reference that the designed UI provided.

3. Functionality of Responsive Navigation Menu:

    The main objectives for the functionality of the navigation menu were for it to look simple, to function smoothly, and to have good cues and feedback for the user. The use of hiding/showing elements, transitions, hover effects, and a burger button that toggles between a burger and an X indicators were key elements in achieving these objectives. 

4. Running the application, dependencies requires, and instructions for testing:

    To run the application, first you will need to ensure you use a laptop or desktop computer, and you have access to a Terminal, whether the native one that comes with your operating system, or one that is built into a third party application like VS Code. Once your have the command line open, use the code "cd res-nav-app" to ensure you are running commands within this react app's directory. Then, simply run "npm start" to render this react SPA in your browser.

    There are not dependiencies required to run this React app. All dependiences that were used in this project we pre-installed and are now built into this project.

    To test this application, it is recommended to use the inspect feature in the internet browser on your computer. More specifically, using the responsive desing mode available in the inspect panel on your browser will allow you to scale the application up and down for different viewport widths.

5. Accessability and Responsive Design:

    For accessibility, I tried to use alt tags for navlinks and logos both on main page and navbar. I tried to use a well contrasted layout and appropriately sized text to allow for better readability of text and locating of elements. As for the responsiveness of the menu, it was ensured that the navbar functions and appears as readable on all screen sizes. 

6. Libraries and Frameworks:

    The only framework used for this assignment was React, with some extra dependencies within it like the router. Otherwise, the css was all written in Vanila HTML, CSS and Javascript, with the use of some learning resources found online on MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and StackOverflow.

7. Inpiration:

    There are no specific web applications that inspired this project. Mainly the idea for a butcher shop website derived from the use of Bacon Ipsum as dummy text, which I find very ammusing to use.
